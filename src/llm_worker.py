"""
Queue receiver for Hermes (the transformation LLM).

This is the only part of the system that actually calls the Hermes LLM
endpoint for transformation requests: LLMorph itself (llm_runner.py) only
ever enqueues a request onto a Redis list and waits for the matching
reply. That split lets many transformation requests be queued up and
served asynchronously, by one or more of these worker processes, instead
of each request blocking LLMorph's own process for the duration of
inference.

Run one (or several, for more throughput) with, from the repository root:
    python src/llm_worker.py

Stop with Ctrl+C.
